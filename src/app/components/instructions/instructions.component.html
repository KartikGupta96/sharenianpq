    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Sharenian PQ (GPQ) Stage 3 Simulator.<br>
        To start, press the "Play" button. Begin by selecting an item under each statue.<br>
        The goal of this stage is to determine the correct combination of the four items. Order Matters!<br> 
        After selecting each statue's item, press the "Submit Answer" button to check the submission.<br>
        If the submission is incorrect, clues for the correct answer will be shown below the button:<br>
        "Correct" = Right item and right place<br>
        "Incorrect" = Right item but wrong place<br>
        "Unknown" = Wrong item<br>
        Unfortunately, the statues won't indicate which items are in the correct spots or not, that's for the player to figure out.<br>
        There are only 7 chances to figure out the correct four items, or the game ends. Choose wisely!<br><br>
        Use the "History" button on the left side to see your previous answers.<br>
        It just might help to solve the puzzle!
